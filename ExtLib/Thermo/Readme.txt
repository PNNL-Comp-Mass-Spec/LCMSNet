For DLLs:
ACQUISITIONLib.dll
AxACQUISITIONLib.dll
XCALIBURFILESLib.dll

These are COM interop DLLs generated by Visual Studio Developer tools.
Manually generating these provides 2 benefits:
1. They are not regenerated automatically at build time, which also permits compiling on a system that does
   not have the necessary files installed/registered (a process that installing Xcalibur normally does).
2. Proper/automatic use of acquisition.ocx in C# requires the use of a Windows Forms control that is loaded;
   using AxImp.exe to generate the interop bypasses this requirement by generating the AxHost AxACQUISITIONLib.dll file, which internally handles this process.

The *ACQUISITIONLib DLLs were created by running the following command from the Visual Studio Developer Prompt:
AxImp.exe C:\Xcalibur\system\programs\acquisition.ocx

This creates the needed interop DLL (ACQUISITIONLib.dll) and the AxHost (ActiveX Host in Windows Forms) DLL AxACQUISITIONLib.dll

The XCALIBURFILESLib DLL was created by running the following command from the Visual Studio Developer Prompt:
tlbimp.exe C:\Xcalibur\system\programs\XcaliburFiles.dll
