PNNL Internal Build Instructions:
Easy way: run buildall.bat with MSBuild in your PATH environment variable.

For release: run buildall.bat with the command line parameter "release" without the quotes, and then run the installer script.

Hard way:
To build a fully functional and up-to-date LcmsNet use:
1.      Build the SDK solution in \LcmsNet\SDK

2.      Build the SQLiteTools solution in \LcmsNet\SQLiteTools

3.      Build the plugin solution in \lcmsnetPlugins

4.      Build the DMS solution in \LcmsNetDmsTools

5.      Build LcmsNet main solution in \LcmsNet\lcms\LCMSnet

6debug. Copy Files from \InternalLibs into the output directory of the main solution. Copy files from \pluginDLLs into the \Plugins directory of the output directory of the main solution.

6deploy. Run LCMSNet_X86-pnnl.iss installer script in the \Installer directory to generate the install file. Inno Setup will be necessary.
